- with oil, fry onions until brownish w/ bit of salt
- add beef to the pot
- add half of the tomatos in the pot

## other remarks

- just tortilla + cheese is already a legit queasadilla

## updates

2018-08-10 tried to use mozzarella cheese as a substitute of oaxaca cheese, only works if you hard press with paper towel and get rid of excess water.

2018-09-23 routinely making Queasadilla's, often for breakfast, or snack. Tryied to put [Gyu-don](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C5%ABdon)(without the rice), and it worked too.
